# Project Governance

The basic principle is that decisions are based on consensus. If this decision-making process takes too long or a decision is required, the project committee has the authority to make a decision.

## Technical Steering Committee

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is responsible for:

1. General ambitions, objectives and goals of this project
2. Guidelines and procedures and tool selection
3. Architectural and (development) infrastructure choices
4. Raise subjects/issues that are important for the direction/development of this project

The community council consists of the following members:

* **Tim Weelinck** - *Development decisions*
* **Raoul Linnenbank** - *Active Development, Bug-fixes, Technical decisions*
* **Joan Ressing** - *Infrastructure and deployment*

**Tim Weelinck** will chair the TSC.

## Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for maintaining parts of the code-base. Maintainers have the following responsibilities

1. Coordinate development activity
2. Make sure code/documentation reviews are being done
3. Coordinate pull-requests
4. Coordinate bug follow-ups
5. Coordinate questions
6. In case of long discussions or arguments, maintainers or other can request a community council decision.

The current maintainers of this project are:
* **Raoul Linnenbank** - *Active Development, Bug-fixes, Technical decisions*
* **Joan Ressing** - *Infrastructure and deployment*

## Contributors

Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the project.

Anyone can become a contributor. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements and no selection process. To become a contributor, a community member simply has to perform one or more actions that are beneficial to the project.
