## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please directly contact us at: [weather.provider@alliander.com](weather.provider@alliander.com)

Upon receiving information on this vulnerability, we will aim to either immediately repair it, or issue a warning via the discussion board, depending on the ease with which it can be fixed. In both cases we will aim to solve the vulnerability as fast as possible.

Should a vulnerability pose an extremely high risk, we may decide to flag releases as "High Risk", and we may issue temporary releases with limited functionality, to prevent our users from being unnecessarily at risk. These events will also be advertised on the Discussions board, and these "High Risk" and "Limited Functionality" releases will be tagged as such.
